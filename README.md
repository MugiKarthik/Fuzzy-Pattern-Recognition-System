# Designing a Fuzzy Pattern Recognition System for Emoji-Based Mood Classification

# Problem Statement
Designing a fuzzy pattern recognition system for classifying the mood of a person based on 
text emojis involves creating a dataset of text emojis with corresponding mood labels. 
Linguistic variables representing emoji features, such as eyes and mouth shape, are defined. 
A rule base is established, mapping emoji features to mood categories through linguistic 
rules. The inference engine applies fuzzy logic operations to determine the degree of 
membership of input variables to each rule. Finally, defuzzification combines fuzzy outputs 
to classify the overall mood.
